Functional requirements describe what the system should do, while non-functional requirements cover performance, usability, security, etc.

**Functional:**

1. Availability to change GPT API model anytime without any limitations.

2. Availability to create «memory points», that could be shown, edited or deleted anytime user would like to do so. (I)

3. 2 types of questioning:
	- dialog boxes that would have their own internal memory, external memory would be applied but it would be second in-order in the comparison to internal dialog memory
	- 1-time question, that could be sent with the understanding of external memory, meaning that the question would be answered based on what the system prompts are; or without external memory, meaning that the question would be sent without any prompts at all.

4. User lvl system with benefits to higher levels. (II)

5. Voluntary administrating platform for higher levels. (III)

6. Availability to make corporate accounts. (IV)

**Non-Functional**:

1. Automatic reports on suspicious activity on accounts.

2. Multi-threaded login system (security measures) with absolutely necessary MFA.

3. Availability on all the platforms and web-browsers as well as the most of the devices.

(I) «Memory points» — key messages, or its' parts, that contain valuable information that given chat session, or the whole user's account, should remember.

(II) Depending on account's activity, each user would have his own user's level. Level would show how much given user use "AIP". When user achieves higher levels, he would get some benefits, e.g. 20% discount on topping-up account. Benefits wouldn't always be about money: it can be everything else user would like.

(III) When user reaches *N-th* level, he would be given an availability to voluntary administrate platform. Administrating would consist of reviewing automatic system reports on suspicious activity on accounts. Ones that would take part in that job would also obtain benefits.

(IV) Corporate accounts would have fixed system prompts, regarding what company does. With that main corporate account it would be possible for employees to connect to main account, creating sub-account with specific rights. Employees with their sub-accounts would ask main account questions, as if they normally would do with seniors. That main corporate account would be maintained by one senior manager and one senior developer in order to give it all the necessary information so that it could answer any question without the need of that company's developers to answer the same question again and again every time newby comes to their company. Also, that account would have «trigger phrases» that would notify seniors that that specific one employee, e.g. asking questions about database table removal so that senior would prevent very common thing: newby deleting whole database
