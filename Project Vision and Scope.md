**Introduction**

Our vision is to create an accessible, customizable AI platform that empowers users to explore and utilize AI technology with greater freedom and control over everything that happens inside our application.

Our goal is to create a product that appears simple at first glance but offers extensive customisation — AI Playground, or "AIP". The product would be based on GPT API, meaning that it would maintain high quality, but also we would like to add more freedom for the simple user.

 Today, people use AI in various ways. For example, students turn to AI to answer questions, while designers seek creative ideas and references. It should not scare to use AI — in the right hands it would only help one become better.
 
 But during usage you can encounter many problems with, e.g. Chat GPT: restrictions in newest models' usage; strict policies on many topics and so on. With our product we would like to give everyone more freedom and help them with customising AI usage experience.

Possibilities that are offered with GPT API are nearly endless. You can give it custom system prompt so it would answer to you in a way that you wish (something similar to existing GPT profiles but much more better). You can rule messages' history as you want, keeping it forever, keeping it for some time or instantly deleting it. You can change to nearly any GPT model that existed at any given time, testing and comparing each one of them to obtain the experience you desire. The platform offers complete flexibility for users to create or refine AI interactions to suit their unique needs.

**«Aim Groups»**

Our product would, without hesitation, attract a lot of attention from many groups of people. We would have several «Aim Groups».

Our primary group consists of young people, from 16 to 24 years old. We would want them to use our product for educational purposes. It is possible to use GPT as a teacher, but "AIP" would give them instruments to create a perfect teacher and a personal mentor.

Professionals from 24 to 40 could leverage "AIP" for streamlined problem-solving, reducing the need for outsourcing. 

Finally, third group would be elder people, that would need "AIP" to assist them in everyday life. It would be very easy to set everything up the way elder people would quickly understand how to use our product.

**Limitations**

Our product is not intended for specific fields that require highly specialised expertise, such as medical assistance, legal consulting, or advanced technical fields. These areas demand deep, domain-specific knowledge and understanding. Instead, "AIP" aims to empower users to enhance their own abilities and foster personal growth in a safe, supportive environment.

"AIP" would give its users much more freedom, but that freedom would not exceed some boundaries that we, as a group, see as appropriate. Some topics, especially illegal in most of the countries, would remain under very strict supervision. We would like our users to be able to ask about anything, but that 'anything' shouldn't be used in a way that would hurt other people. As long as users don't intend on harming or bullying anyone, they would have their freedom.
