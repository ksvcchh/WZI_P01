# Architecture Description

The architecture is designed for scalability, reliability and cost efficiency. All application components are deployed on AWS. Below is justifications for each component and an explanation of the logical and physical architecture

## Justification for Technology Choices

- **AWS**
    AWS provides scalable, reliable and cost-efficient solutions for hosting and managing the application. Its manadeg services (e.g., S3, EC2, ElastiCache) reduces operational overhead and simplify infrastructure management.

- **EC2**
    EC2 is chosen for backend deployment because it provides flexible, scalable compute resources and seamless integration with other AWS services. EC2 offers auto-scaling based on traffic load, ensuring performance during peak times.

- **Redis**
    Redis offers fast, in-memory caching to reduce application latency. It is ideal for storing frequently accessed or temporary data, such as intermideate responces or user session data.

- **PostgreSQL**
    A robust relational database that provides reliable structured data storage. It is well-suited for storing user chat history and application configuration.

- **S3**
    Amazon S3 ensures cost-effective, durable and scalable storage for static assets, historical data, logs or other critical information.

## Architecture

1. **User**:
    User access the application through a webpage, interacting with the frontend to send messages and receive AI-generated responses.

2. **Frontend**:
    A React or Angular applictaion, provides the user interface. It communicates with backend through REST API. Static assets are hosted on Amazon S3.

3. **Backend**:
    Server-side application built with python (Flask), Node.js (Express) or Java (Spring Boot). It handles API requiests, processes business logic, manages interactions with services. It is deployed on Amazon EC2. Responsibilities:
    - Validates and processes user requests.
    - Requests responses from OpenAI API.
    - Caches data in Redis to optimize performance.
    - Stores persistent data in PostgreSQL.
    - Periodically uploads historical data to S3.

4. **Redis**:
    Acts as an in-memory cache to store frequently accessed or temporary data, reduces backend response times and database load. Managed Redis instance provided by Amazon ElastiCache.

5. **PostgreSQL**:
    The primary data storage for the application, used to store user chat history, configurations and other structured data. Managed database instance provided by Amazon RDS.

6. **S3**:
    Hosts static frontend assets and acts as long-term storage for historical data.

7. **OpenAI API**:
    Provides access for advanced AI models.

## **Dataflow**

1. Users interact with the application though a browser. Requests are sent to the backend via frontend using REST API.

2. Static assets for the frontend application are served from S3.

2. User inputs are validated and processed by the backend. The backend interacts with OpenAI API to get AI-generated responses. Results may be cached in Redis for faster retrieval during sessions.

3. User chat history is saved in PostgreSQL for long-term storage. Periodic backups of data are uploaded to S3 for achival and disaster recovery.
